          When you bring people with different strengths, skills, and personalities together you 
          get an unstoppable team. Our diverse backgrounds and talents allow us to complement each 
          other’s weaknesses and blindspots to create a company that’s moving ever forward.

            We take full advantage of globalization and remote work to welcome the most driven 
            and outstanding people from all over the world into SOE. Although our headquarters 
            is located in Toronto, Canada, we have dozens of remote team members working internationally. 
            Building our foundation upon a mix of different cultures and values gives us the opportunity 
            to see varying perspectives, and helps us find better solutions to the challenges we face daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            To guide our every decision we look toward our 4Gs and 4Cs which shape our company’s driven 
            yet inclusive culture. Although we value excellent skills and promising talent, above all 
            what we’re looking for is a team player who fits into the SOE family.
